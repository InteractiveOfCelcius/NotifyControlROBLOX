# Notify Control

Notify Control v573m. Notify UI Lib for roblox executors.

This is to create your own scripts with custom notifications without the boring roblox notifications.

please do not judge by the versions as this script was created by me but I deleted it.

NOTE: This script is still in beta. Please contact me if there are bugs or problems. Thanks. psvks#4788

## Documentation

```lua
notify(<any>, <any>)

EX: notify("TITLE", "DESCRIPTION")

testNotify(<void>)

EX: nothing cus is just a usless shit function

A simple documentation, but I will be updating and changing the functions.
