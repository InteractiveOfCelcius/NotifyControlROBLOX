# Notify Control

Hello, this project will not be updated until it is patched in the next versions of ROBLOX. (may be idk. im busy asf ngl)

This is to create your own scripts with custom notifications without the boring roblox notifications.

NOTE: the script is literally quite simple as I created it in 30 minutes.

## Documentation

```lua
notify(<any>, <any>)

EX: notify("TITLE", "DESCRIPTION")

testNotify(<void>)

EX: nothing cus is just a usless shit function
```

A simple documentation, but I will be updating and changing the functions.
